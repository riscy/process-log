A minor mode to keep a log of processes invoked by Emacs and Emacs packages.
This can be useful for benchmarking, debugging, auditing, or just for
curiosity's sake. Note this may affect the performance of some packages.

To use process-log, add the following to your =.emacs=:
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/process-log/")
  (require 'process-log)
  (process-log-mode 1)    ; start logging
#+end_src

This creates a buffer called =*process-log*=, which resembles the following:
#+begin_src change-log

where each row is comprised of:
- a timestamp
- the "blame" token indicating which package invoked the process;
  the =help-echo= (mouseover) shows 20 relevant backtrace frames
- the binary, whose full path is shown in its =help-echo=
- the binary's full argument list
